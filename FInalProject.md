# **Protecting Your Investments (Final Project)**
## **How Economic and Market Conditions Can Predict Bond Yields And Guide Your Future Investment Decisions**

### **Introduction**
  (Note: I will be expanding on my introduction next and also including some screenshots of the Fed's statements and/or diagrams showing the impacts of inflation or the bond yield curve, but I wanted to add some preliminary thoughts first.)
  There have been numerous articles this year describing not only rising costs of common household purchases like poultry and vegetables, but also in the costs of bigger purchases like housing and materials that companies need to produce electronic devices.  In light of the Federal Reserve's recent decision to continue raising interest rates for the foreseeable future to help combat this inflation, the yields on short-term securities have risen to their highest levels in decades.  Typically, the yields on short-term bonds that mature within 2-5 years have lower yields than long-term bonds that mature with 10-30 years because there is less risk in investing in a security that will pay you back your money (plus interest) relatively quickly than investing in a security that will not allow you to receive the principal payment for several decades, as it is less clear what market conditions will be like in the long-term.  However, since the Federal Reserve announced its new policy to begin raising interest rates, this pattern has been inverted with yields on shorter-term bonds rising above those of 10-year+ bonds.  This indicates that investors are expecting the Federal Reserve to continue increasing interest rates into the near future and are less clear about what the value of their dollar will be in this near-term.
